## The Beginning of a Journey

With this post, Iâ€™m starting something Iâ€™ve wanted to do for a long time.

I created this project to see how much knowledge I really have in the world of programming. Since Iâ€™m mainly a web developer, I decided to build a project that leans into that skill set. But right at the beginning, I realized something important:

**I have no clue about project planning or architecture design.**

Iâ€™ll admit â€” Iâ€™ve been relying on large language models to help me figure out a lot of things. Much of the code was generated with the help of AI tools.

- ðŸ§  For planning and getting inspiration, I use **ChatGPT**.  
- ðŸ’» For generating code snippets, Iâ€™ve used **Claude AI**.  

That said, I donâ€™t want to depend on these tools forever.

### What Iâ€™m Working On

My main challenge is that Iâ€™m still lacking some basic knowledge â€” but Iâ€™m determined to **learn everything I need** to bring this project to life, from start to finish.

### Why Share This?

If you're interested in the story of a newbie programmer who barely knows what he's doing but is learning along the way â€” then **follow me on this journey**. There will be struggles and setbacks, for sure, but Iâ€™m confident in myself, and Iâ€™m not going to give up.

This is just the beginning.
